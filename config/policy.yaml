# Three independent axes:
#   mode               - what the system does
#   security_posture   - how defensive the system is
#   performance_profile - speed vs thoroughness tradeoff
#
# Modes:
#   development - max logging, relaxed thresholds, no signatures
#   production  - strict invariants, rate-limiting, signed intents
#   paranoid    - high consensus quorum, VM sandbox, minimal trust
#   forensic   - read-only, deep analysis, replay-only
#
# Security Postures:
#   open     - no signatures, no reputation checks
#   guarded  - signatures required, basic reputation
#   hardened - strict validation, elevated thresholds
#   lockdown - maximum restrictions, minimal trust
#
# Performance Profiles:
#   eco      - minimal resources, shallow analysis
#   balanced - default operating point
#   turbo    - deep analysis, high throughput
